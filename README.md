Some examples of composition pattern and reuse.

I believe these are two good examples if you try to learn Java, Composition and Re-Use in programming.

1-) The first example is about books and authors (literature).

2-) The second example was about lines and points. (also there is a circle, because circle has also a point--in the middle)

If you carefully read the codes that I have provided, you will learn a lot about the basics of Java as well. For example, you can
learn about how to create instances of classes and write some tests to check out whether your code is working as expected or not. But all
in all, those are very simple and primitive examples. 

Try to fully understand those examples, if you have any concerns or problems, you can definitely send me an e-mail. I will be very glad to
help you!
